# Password-generator-

whilst the HTML and CSS was given, the task was to use javascript to create a password generator that incorporates between 8 to 126 characters which include numerical, alphabetical and special characters. I implemented features we learnt in the previous work in order to create a successful password generator that (hopefully) meets the criteria.
